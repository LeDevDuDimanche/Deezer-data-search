# Deezer-data-search
Deezer song search api. I used [react data grid](https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid) and [react boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)(which includes react, redux, saga, reselect, i18n, jest, ...) to obtain the final result.

As I used react boilerplate to start this project, you can look at [this page](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/blob/master/docs/general/commands.md) to see the set of npm commands used to run this project.

I wrote some tests using jests which are located in app/containers/App/tests/selectors.test.js. You can run the the test suite using npm test. I changed the package.json file testRegex's variable so that only the tests in this file are run.
